			Not everyone likes javascript.  Many times people will disable it because it can be regarded as annoying pop up spam.  JavaScript can also have security issues associated with it like XSS attacks.  If we think of a webpage like an icecream cone, javascript would be the sprinkles on top.  Its nice to have sprinkles enabled but should your sprinkles be required for your cone to work, your going to have a bad time.
